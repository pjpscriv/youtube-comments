Ugw_JtW90dUqaSxGnT94AaABAg,Non Linear Assault,1 month ago,1529841783182,"The storytelling in the video is insane. At first we got the cringe cap boy in the right, the glasses girl on the left, the fat bold dude behind, and the jeans girl at the right.

Cringe boy is clearly here to fuck, doesn't give a shit about the music. Doesn't even try to look like he's into it at first. As soon as he sees jeans girl, he harass her (1:12). And by harassing I don't mean talking: cringeboy walks on her from behind and put his head on her neck and tells her stuff. She quickly reject him, good on her.

While this happens, bald fat dude is a bit shy: he is enjoying the music but he's not confident enough to be at ease while dancing. He also wants to meet girls, but he's too shy. So all he does is looking at the 2 hot girls around him: jeans girl, and glasses girl. He quickly notice cringeboy and see how cringy he is.

Bald shy dude concentrates on looking at glasses girl: she's hot, and she knows how to move. He also likes how she's confident to completely let go and follow the beat. Some other dudes are looking at her in the back too.

Meanwhile, cringeboy is a bit confused by the rejection he faced: now he doesn't move anymore, and checks his cellphone.
There are some comic reliefs here: first a dude who comes in front of the dj to brush his fabulous hair, and then some dude makes a joke to bald dude telling him that he's also bald (he takes off his cap). They laugh.

After a while, a new girl walks in: the black girl with the white shirt. She moves with the beat, she got it. Cringeboy quickly notices her and try to approach his head like he did on jeans girl. Apparently he is confident that he got the rightful approach. White shirt girl doesn't give a fuck but knows she has a creepy cringeboy behind her: so she turns back and seeks contact in the crowd, to make him understand.

But then! It creates an opening in the vision of cringeboy, and he sees this beautiful lady dancing. It's glasses girl! He get her attention and she calls him. Bingo! Bald guy is devastated. Wtf are you doing cringeboy? I was writing a plan in my head for that girl!

Cringeboy is in heaven. He found a girl who is okay with him being all touchy! Yeah! But what he doesn't understand is that that's how glasses girl dance, and she's just here to dance. He wants to make her see how funny he is so he steals the microphone from the dj, which quickly tell him to stop being so fucking cringy. Glasses girl is understanding that cringeboy is not here to dance and she disappears in the crowd. The guy behind cringeboy was watching all along and he tells him some joke.

Bald dude smiles. Take that, cringeboy! He's still constantly looking at cringeboy.

Anyway the music is really cool

,,,,,,,,UggZoCB_kYCUxngCoAEC.8Me7k3Msc_i8cS2Pz1_nyF,Kevin Chapman,5 months ago,1519473983990,"Thus ends the video epic of an amazing guy who just wanted to have fun and dance. Shall we call him Pierre? Hes French/Canadian so yes,  lets call him Pierre. Pierre came to the club ready to party. He had a stressful week at work. He'd been written up for inappropriate comments to his coworkers. He was only kidding of course, just trying to have a fun a what he felt was a dead end job. People often take ""light hearted""Pierre wayyyy too seriously amd reject his humor and advances. Meanwhile, Pierre ""the lighthearted"" merely just wants to have a good time. Sure he popped a few pills before coming in to the club! And OF COURSE he washed them down with Vodka and Hennessey.... But thats not the point. He was merely trying to rebuild his shattered confidence after his work reprimand.   When he saw the little short girl in the funky jeans at 1:20, he was merely coaching her to do more than just bop  around off beat. Sound advice! He really wanted to see her move. She ignored this valuable advice and continued boppin off beat. He had given it his best. He took a swig of beer and moved on. He then moved on to the tall,skinny, pretty girl that danced off beat like a giraffe. He tried vigorously to get her on beat, but she too refused and ended the dance affair by walking away, only to stun us with more horrible dance moves for the next 40 minutes. Kaytranada eventually got her on beat later on for about 5 seconds near the end of the set..... but I digress ...this is Pierre's story. Pierre then saw the red faced sweaty dude( already sweating after 4 mins) & did his best to coach him through his horribly erratic/ crazy dance moves as well. For some reason red face sweaty guy kept loling at Pierres advice and even knocked off his hat in mockery. RedNSweaty followed that demeaning act immediately with a shocklingly bad outburst of off beat dancing. It was a lost caude. Saddened but not discouraged Pierre moved on. A young lady with mediocre moves speaks to him at 6:10... Pierre tells her hes got bigger fish to fry and keeps it moving. He didnt reject her, he was merely triaging the worst cases of dancing. Alarmed at the plague of Rhythm deafness infecting Kaytranada's dance floor, Pierre took it upon himself to SAVE THE NIGHT by grabbing Kays mic and providing ON THE SPOT coaching to those currently ruining the dance floor. Sadly Kay had turned off the mic. Kay, Focused on his amazing set, simply was able to ignore most of the trespasses against the laws of rhythm that took place that night. Those Kay was able to witness he quietly washed away with Random gulps of PBR and Heineken throughout the set. Later on in the evening ""light hearted"" Pierre was able to provide coaching to other dancers and can be seen popping in camera view and pointing out moments of success. Later that night Pierre got sick and threw up in the Bathroom. He slipped and fell in his own puke, hit his head and went unconscious. He woke up to the large long haired Sasquatch kid with the football Jersey lifting him up and asking if he was  ok. He was. He told this kid thank you and that it was up to him (Sasquatch) to save the night. Pierre told Sas (Sasquatch) in order to save the night he must steal the hat of the least coordinated dancer (Cute Giraffe girl), get alarmingly close to the two best dancers(Kay/Shia) with said hat on and CRUSH it with vigorously coordinated arms movements to a Janet Jackson song. Only then would the night be saved and Kays boiler room would become the most epic ever. Sas, took it upon himself and listened to Pierre. Not only did he CRUSH IT at the 28:30 mark, but he murdered it. Kay was so taken aback that he had to hold Sas back . The power and forces of his moves nearly ruined the equipment.  Pierre had accomplished his purpose. Hed set the night off amd forgot about his write up. He helped Kays boiler room set become epic, despite all his initial rejection. He sat against the wall with pride and popped another pill in celebration. The rest of the night was blury, but hell, Pierre was winning! Sure the next day he came to work late, the day after his write up, sure he was fired, but it was ok, Pierre hated that job. He knew his calling was making people dance...ON BEAT. Today Pierre runs his own dance studio for the Rhythm impaired. Sasquatch even comes to help out. Pierre is living his dream, and you saw it all begin here.

Sittin over here
Starin in your face
With lust in my eyes
Sure don't give a damn and ya
Don't know that I've been dreamin of ya in
My fantasies
Never once you looked at me
Don't even realize that I'm wantin you
To fulfill my needs
Think what you want
Let your mind free
Run free to a place no one dares to

How many night I've laid in bed excited over you
I've closed my eyes and thought of us a hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times I wonder how bout you
Day and night
Night and day
All I've got to say is

[CHORUS:]
If I was your girl
Oh the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not
So I can't
Then I won't
But
If I was your girl

Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time cuz we've got all night, oooh
You on the rise as you're touchin my thighs and
Let me know what you like
If you like I'll go
Down da down down down da down down
I'll hold you in my hand and baby

Your smooth and shiny
Feels so good against my lips sugar
I want you so bad I can
Taste your love right now baby
Day and night
Night and day
All i've got to say is",1

I know you don't need drugs to enjoy a party. I go out relatively sober or with only 2-3 beers and a little weed a lot actually.¬†

But I've also taken MDMA, which is a fantastic drug if you know how to use it safely (!), and in her case it's really obvious. She's sweating A LOT, her jaw is constantly clenching (common side effect of ecstasy, especially at higher doses) and the way she moves is almost a dead giveaway.

I'm not judging her, as said I've taken the stuff myself and I will do it again in the future. I bet she had a total blast!",1

Deep House started in the late 1980's. Electro House started early 2000's. There are multiple people who thrive in both of these genres and people go to sets live more often than any other electronic genre nowadays. Look at UMF 2014. Do you really think that every single person there is a hipster because they enjoy going to see electronic live? Just because someone plays it and it's on Boiler Room, live, or because you can't name a single artist doesn't mean it's hipster. Kaytranada isn't even a house artist, this is funk and Hip Hop. Both of these have been around longer than both of those genres combined. Please get your facts straight before you comment.",3

people who show up to a party not to take drugs, or or bug the dj about the newest lil wayne song but, instead they show up to dance and have a good time. ¬†This is one of the most lively boilerroom performances i've seen aside from the LA one. ¬†

The cool thing now is to hate ""hipsters"" but, I love when hipsters show up at my shows. ¬†You know people are actually gonna dance when there's hipsters around. ¬†Honestly Kaytranada is one of the most soulful producers making dance music right now. ¬†You really can't hate on that .... yeah he's using traktor and he's really not beat-matching but, 85-90% of the music he's playing is music he made yourself hence most of the ""hipsters"" dancing in this video are actual fans that prolly pay for his releases.

You can see that green shirt/cap dude was around into the trap music that everyone else played before... but then, he was like ""its late (I done had some e/molly), let me try to get some cause I aint dancing"". That bohemian girl was milling about before, but she moved up FRONT TO REPRESENT FOR KAYTRANADA. At the beginning of this video, it looks like she was trying to get the tall dude with the mavericks hat to join her, but he was like ""Naw naw naw..."" That is what friends of DJs do, she also tapped him to say ""I'm here, let's get it!"". Also you can see that Kayt moved those other people up there, they are in the back in all other sets that night... The skinny girl in the tartan skirt was calmer in the other sets... You can see in KenLo's last half that she was starstruck, all of her failed model aspirations came out... That night she probably went back home with her girlfriend with the octopus hair and they ate each other out after giving all the dudes (at the event) aoi tama...

Ugg5yVRmGtGqxngCoAEC,tmacthenumber1,4 years ago,1406203936392,"Let's clear a few things:
-Haters need to stfu. Everyone was just having fun. We in Montreal are incredibly proud of Kaytra and it was damn great to just have fun and dance to the homie's killer set. Most Boiler Rooms only has people on their cellphones. Montreal is that city.
-Fat Joe look-alike is one of Kaytra's closest friends, they went to HS together, him not being the best dancer ever doesn't mean shit, he belonged as much as anyone.
-Guy who combs his fro around the 2 minutes mark is High-Klassified and he also had a set during that BR, a sick producer who 's part of Alaiz, the same collective Kaytra is part of.
-Guy with the number 99 jersey and long hair is Tommy Kruise, and he doesn't give 2 shits what you all think, lol.
-Glasses girl was indeed really ratchet, not many people enjoyed her presence that night.
-Light-skin girl who dances her ass off is a good friend of Kaytra, and she's not doing it for the camera, she dances like hell whether the cams are there or not. She also sings:¬†https://soundcloud.com/stwosc/virgo ¬†(the girl on the photo of that song is random, it's not Shay)
-There were definitely a few people on molly that night, but not more than half. The other half is just people who support the local talent and enjoy the hell out of the music.
-Oh and the guy with the green cap really got shut down hard, and on more occasions than you know, as a lot happened off camera too. He was an incredible tool AND fag though, definitely not there for the music.",10,true,1,,,,,,
